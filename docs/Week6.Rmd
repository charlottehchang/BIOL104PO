# Merging datasets

Tentatively, the `R` tutorial for this week will focus on merging datasets. Specifically, we will see how to combine county-level socioeconomic data from the Census bureau with the ecological data on the [Provided Datasheet](https://github.com/charlottehchang/BIOL104PO/blob/master/data/CA_protectedareas_datasheet.tsv). 

# Sustainable vs. unsustainable exploitation

In a forthcoming `R Shiny` app, I will ask you to toggle different life history and harvest parameters for a fish species that is harvested. By manipulating these values, you will see how they affect the dynamics of the exploited fishery.
